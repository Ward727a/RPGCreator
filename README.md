# ‚öî RPGCreator üèπ
## This project is still in devlopment, so it's not at all ready to be used, I created this repository mainly for me to be able to keep the code in a safeplace

*A free, open-source, fully editable RPG Maker alternative made in Godot.*

---
### Why?

I wanted a long time ago use RPG Maker for a small game, but I come to some problems:
- The engine is not open-source (I come from Godot)
- Not free
- The plugins systems was... really not good (Hard to install, hard to create, hard to maintain, no **official** documentation)
- The engine capabilities was nice, but not really "permissive"

And I was like "How the hell can this engine work so much with so many problems?!", I started to search for alternative, first free, then open-source, and yeah, I understood why this engine worked so much, there was no true, good and maintained alternative, some were open-source but were not maintained and their interface was not really at my taste (But they really did a good job, I don't criticize them, this is so much work)

So I decided to create my own :)

## üó£ Discord Server
If you want to follow the project you can join the official discord server right here:
discord.gg/4yfq4NNzs4

On this server you can ask question, propose feature, talk with the community, see some sneak-peek and check the changelog!
Sometime I will be in voice channel with my screen shared so you can see me work and talk to me! :)

# ‚ùî FAQ
- Why publish this on github when this project is not finished?

Well because this is my way of doing thing, your free to help me, or just wait for some news :)
- Will this project be really free and open-source? How will you gain money for this?

Yes, this project will be totaly free and open-source as long as I'm not dead. For now I don't want to think of "how will I gain money" because this project is not finished, and I don't want to ask money to people for a project that is not finished, and when I don't even know if this project will finish one day. **Please not however:** I will NEVER block feature behind "premium" version of this engine or other thing like that, if I trully want to gain money for this, it will a donation based, no ads, no premium feature or other thing like that.
- Will this engine be multi-language?

Yes! At first the engine will be available in English and French (English because.. well: International Language, and French, because I'm french) but you're free to help for the translation of the engine (See the wiki for this)
- Can I create my own engine forked from it?

I'm really not an expert with all the license thing, so yes? If you check the license and see something that block this, please open an issue, I will look into this (if you got a better license, do not hesitate to give it!)
- If I create a game on this engine, if I sold it, will I need to give a % ?

0, nothing, don't care, it's your game, your work, your money, don't even think of this.
- Why Godot?

First it's a game engine, so I don't need to write the most "problematic" code parts, second because.. I want to, I like Godot, and I wanted to try make it with it, Godot is Free & Open-source, it respected the condition I setted to my-self, so I decided to use this.
- Will this engine be available for \[OS]?

Yes? Probably? I don't really know at the point of writing this, I will try to make it as avaible as possible!
- Will there be a documentation of: "how create a plugin" or "how to edit the engine"?

Yes! I will take some time when the engine is ready to create a good wiki with as much details as possible, and if one day you need to know something, do not hesitate to contact me! :)
- Will this support 3D or only 2D?

To being totally honest: I really want to support 3D and 2D, but to begin the engine will only support 2D!
- What language will be used for plugins?

I'm still thinking about that, maybe GDScript or LUA, maybe both, I don't know as I'm still on the "idea" part of the plugins system! There will be no JS Support as I don't like this language, but maybe one day? Who know.
- Is there a starting assets pack? (Like characters textures, tilemaps, etc...)

Maybe?
I'm not a graphic designer or an assets maker, I can do some small edit / thing, but I can't create full assets pack, I'm still in contact with someone to try to implement (free - I don't have the money to support the creation of so many assets) assets in the engine, I will not disclose the username of this person for now as I still don't know if this person will accept. 
If you want to help by adding your assets for **free** to the engine with **credits**, contact me! (Just to be clear: If you come and ask for money in exchange of this, I will refuse, **I totally understand that it takes time and materials, but I don't have the money to buy assets (which will be given away for free afterwards)**.
- OK, so I want to add my assets to the engine but in exchange of money, is there really no way?

For now, no, BUT at a latter date I will see if I can create an assets "store", where you can sell / give your assets, plugins...

However if I do that, there will be some rules to respect to sell your thing as I don't want to be any abuse. (To be clear: There will be no comission for the sell, all the money that you gain from this assets store will return to you directly - you will just need to pay the TAX, can't evade the government after all ü§£)

What I mean by abuse: "MY SUPER ASSETS WITH 10 POTION TEXTURE FOR JUST 50$, BUY NOW!!! FOR THE SUMMER IT WILL ONLY COST 10$!!!" - Apart if the texture are of extremly good quality (animation, 4K, ...), no, I don't think it should cost 50$ for this.

For now I don't want to start working on this, I want **first finish the engine**, then see if I can found someone trustworthy to work with me on the assets store (rules, moderation, ...), and MAYBE once I have all this, there will be a way to sell your assets.
