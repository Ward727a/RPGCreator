## __0CorePlugin
This plugin is the core plugin of the engine.
It need to be present with the software otherwise the UI will not be present.

If you need to edit the UI, you have two solutions:
	- Edit this script (Not recomended)
	- Create a new plugin that will edit the UI via the InterfaceManager (recomended)
